[{"content":" This article was partially machine translated\nI started keeping accounts in April 2023. I stopped in April 2025.\nMy last entry: ¥0\nThe Beginning: To Save Money and Gain Control It all started very simply — I wanted to control my spending and build better financial awareness. And in the beginning, it really worked. I successfully curbed some of my bad spending habits.\nThe Process: Stepping Into the World of Optimization and Card Collecting Gradually, in pursuit of “better” consumption, I started comparing everything, looking for the optimal choice. At first, it was just comparing product prices. Later, it expanded to payment methods, tools, and eventually to bank promotions and card applications.\nI applied for cards for discounts, then for convenience, and eventually just for collecting them. Step by step, I had fallen deep into the card-collecting world.\nWhat started as saving money, turned into convenience, and ended up becoming card collecting.\nThe Backfire: When Accounting Became a Burden And so, accounting itself slowly became a burden. More and more accounts, more and more complex scenarios — the time cost and mental cost of bookkeeping had long exceeded its actual benefits.\nThere were times I spent hours researching just to save a few bucks. At first, that felt fun. But after doing it over and over, finding the optimal solution no longer excited me — it just left me feeling empty.\nThe Change: From Seeking The Best to Seeking Comfort Maybe I’ve changed. My approach to consumption has changed too.\nFrom “maximize savings” to “close enough, as long as I’m comfortable.”\nI realized I had already broken through my original spending limits, yet I didn’t lose control. On the contrary, I came to understand more deeply: compared to saving money, my time and my happiness mattered more.\nThe Reflection: Why Am I Even Keeping Accounts? Because of bookkeeping, I started to:\nConstantly dig through records because I had too many accounts Create new accounts in the app frequently due to currency conversions Spend a long time hesitating over whether I should buy something Have my mood ruined during outings with friends over spending details That made me reflect — Why am I even doing this?\nIs it really worth it for the so-called “gains” from bookkeeping?\nThe Decision: Letting Go, Reset, Move On So I tried to let go, to not fuss over the details, and simply asked myself:\n“Am I happy?”\nAnd the result was — yes, I was really happy. And my spending wasn’t as high as I imagined either.\nPerhaps my habits had already trained me to naturally compare prices. Or maybe, emotional value is something that can never be measured by discounts.\nTherefore, I think it’s time to let go.\nAccounting has fulfilled its mission.\nIt’s no longer a tool, but a shackle.\nHabits are meant to improve life.\nIf they can no longer be sustained by passion, and instead get in the way of living, then it’s time to learn to say goodbye.\nThe Ending: Thank You, and Keep Living Giving up a habit I’ve maintained for two years is indeed a little bittersweet.\nBut maybe this is also a part of life. Nothing stays with us forever, but as long as the time spent together was beautiful, that’s enough.\nPerhaps I’ve lost a symbolic tool that made me feel like “I’m good at saving money.”\nBut more than that, I hope my future self won’t rely on numbers and records for a sense of security, but instead, live with true ease and freedom.\nFrom being in control, to flowing into the unknown.\nI hope I can adapt soon.\nAnd I hope I can spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and more joyful.\nThe Last Entry, ¥0 Leaving a short note here.\nThank you to myself for two years of dedicated tracking.\nFrom now on, I hope to spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and joyful.\nAnd just like that, I archived this experience.\nRecording ends, but life is only just beginning.\n","date":"2025-04-14T16:23:48+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/244/","title":"From Saving Money, To Living Life, To Saying Goodbye"},{"content":" This article was partially machine translated\nIntroduction Is there a a way to study language listening without feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re studying, sometimes you can listen to repeatedly and try shadowing? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that music!\nI thought about that I only understand part of songs I listen to. If I analyze and understand the lyrics more deeply, maybe I can really treat it as language practice.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start with the first song, which, although a little heavy, has accompanied me for most of my time.
